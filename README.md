Run through problemSolver.py

I will update this readme with some more images and info on the project. For now:

At the time Linux/Unix install was neccessary as although some solvers (e.g. IPOPT) could be run on windows, the tools to make them compatible with Dymos were only for Linux.

I was not great with specifying depencies but I believe you need:

OpenMDAO + Dymos, IPOPT (or another such as ma57), NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy

I don't recall which versions of these I used.
